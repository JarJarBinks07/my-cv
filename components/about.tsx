      Starting in 2015, I proudly wore my graduation cap, symbolizing countless late-night coding sessions, tough algorithms, and breakthroughs. Equipped with a strong foundation, I ventured into the wide world of software development.Driven by a passion for both frontend and backend technologies, I explored the world of React.js, Angular.js, Node.js, and more. Embracing the mobile landscape, I mastered React Native to craft smooth experiences across different devices. In the realm of mobile apps, I rode alongside Android Studio and XCode, ensuring perfection with TestFlight and TestFairy.What sets me apart is more than just coding languages. I collaborate closely with clients, understanding their visions and needs to create solutions that match their dreams.

      Here I stand–ßa Full-Stack Jedi, harmonizing logic, creativity, and collaboration. Each project adds to my journey, a testament to my endless pursuit of excellence. With every line of code, I leave my mark on the digital canvas, guiding others on their remarkable paths.
